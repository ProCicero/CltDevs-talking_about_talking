# Talking about Talking

Talking in a meeting, talking to a group of people, talking to potential investors, it all comes down to one basic thing: you are telling a story. The story is the basic unit of communication between humans for as long as humans have been living and working together. You can greatly simplify most anything you have to say by seeing it as a story. While there may be a different, better framework to use in a specific situation, a story is a good general one to use as a default option.

## Introduction

The basic unit of communication in human relations is the story. This one unit can convey all relevant information to accomplish some goal. You tell stories to kids to teach. You tell stories to your friends to relive and share past experiences. You tell stories to your coworkers to share information and to motivate them to do something. Most all of your communciation can be seen as telling and listening to stories.

## What to Say

A good way to come up with what to say is to think about it as a story. Where is the starting point? What does the end look like? Where does the path from start to end go through? What happens on the way? If you can come up with answers to these questions, then you have most of the job done. For example, the story for this presentation is:

`I have a lot of experience talking to juries, judges, and lawyers. I saw that I was pretty good at doing it, so I tried to learn a lot about doing it. Along the way I studied a lot about the different parts that go into it, including classical rhetoric, speechwriting, and persuasion. While trying to understand what tied all of this information together, I realized that the story is a good way to do it, becuase it is how humans have naturally communciated with each other since the beginning of time. It provides a way to think about how to structure information, how to convey information, an how to make it memorable.`

- Use the story to determine what to _include_ and what to _exclude_.
- Try creating a simple children's story about your topic to come up with ideas.

## Where to Say It

All stories have a beginning, a middle, and an ending. Take all of the information you have and see where it fits. Use the beginning to set up the situation and show what things are like now. Use the middle to say where you went and what you did. This is also going to be where most of your information is going to be shared. Use the ending to show where you want the audience to be.

- Simon Lancaster's TEDx speech, [The Art of Spin](https://youtu.be/_TJFdAtTe6M) does a great job explaining the power of metaphors, which are largely the same way stories work.

## How to Say It

 It is nearly impossible to plan out ahead of time every single gesture you want to convey, and you should not do that. What you want to do is look at the natural flow of your story and keep that in mind. Most all of these techiques are just explanations of what comes naturally. At most, find a few devices that can be used to highlight the few main points you want to make.

- There are hundreds of rhetorical devices. See [Silva Rhetoricae](http://rhetoric.byu.edu/) for a very comprehensive list.
- Find a few that work best, do not overdo them.
- You tell stories different ways depending on the audience you are telling them to. Do the same thing for speeches.

## Remembering What to Say

Looking at your presetation as a story make remembering what to say a lot simpler. You want to remember _what_ to say, not how you want to say it. You want to _rehearse_ what you are going to stay, not memorize it. Use a memory palace, which will dovetail nicely with a story about a journey.

- The human brain is very good at spacial actions, including memory.
- Blocking movements ahead of time will aid in memory as well, allowing you to more easily recover from interruptions.
- Having a vivid story with vivid imagery helps your audience recall what you said, and will also help you remember what you want to say.

## Actually Saying what you are going to Say

Delivery is where you plan _how_ you are going to tell your story. This is the mechanics of speaking, which includes tempo, pace, volume, articulation. This also includes blocking, which not only gives a visual element to your speech, but also helps with memorization.

- Roger Love's _Vocal Power_ is a good source for vocal techniques.
- Rehersal will also help with voice strength.
- Learn how to **project** your voice and not just talk louder. You can talk nonstop for hours with no loss of voice just by learning proper voice and breathing techniques.
- With a little bit of practice, you will not need amplification for most types of presentations.

## Further reading

These are the books that I have found to be very useful in speaking and presentations. Most of them cover more than just the idea of storytelling, but all have provided me with some insight into public speaking.

### _Words Like Loaded Pistos_ 
#### by Sam Leith

A great introduction to classical rhetoric, Leith takes the basic outline provided by classical rhetoric and brings it up to modern-day use. This is probably the best introduction to classical rhetoric I have found so far. If you want a good general overview on how speeches and persuasion work, start with this book.

### _Speechwriting: The Expert Guide_ 
#### by Simon Lancaster

Simon Lancaster is a British speechwriter with great insights into the theory and mechanics of both writing persuasive speeches and delivering them. His YouTube videos are some of the best sources and demonstrations of the techniques he teaches. He builds a bridge between classical rhetoric and its techniques to its modern day applications.

This book is more of a step-by-step guide to speechwriting, both for speeches you will deliver and those you may write for another person to deliver. This is one of the more practical guides I have found so far. If you want more of a step-by-step guide for writing a speech, then this is the one to get. A waring though, most all of his examples are drawn from the UK, so you might have some trouble understanding them.

### _Winning Minds: Secrets from the Language of Leadership_ 
#### by Simon Lancaster

Lancaster's second book, this one is a more generalized approach than _Speechwriting_. It covers the same ground as the previous book, but with a broader focus on more than just speechwriting. 

### _Thank You for Arguing_ 
#### by Jay Heinrichs

A modern-day discourse on classical rhetoric, it is more geared towards creating, refining, and delivering arguments. There are still a lot of good gems to find in this book. While I enjoyed the book and strongly recommend it, the author's style is very close to "stream of consciousness", and might not be the best for everyone. This book actually serves as a good supplement to _Words Like Loaded Pistols_ above. Try to read a sample chapter first to see if they author's style works for you.

### _Word Hero_ 
#### by Jay Heinrichs

A more focused book on coming up with memorable ideas and lines to deliver them. This is very useful for coming up with memorable one-liners to quickly get someone's attention. He takes many memorable lines and breaks them down into parts to see what makes them memorable, then shows you how to use those ideas to create your own. If you are looking for the first line of your elevator pitch, this is a good place to start. It is written in the same style as his other book.
